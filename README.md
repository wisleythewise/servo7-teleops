# LeIsaac 🚀

https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/763acf27-d9a9-4163-8651-3ba0a6a185d7

This repository provides teleoperation functionality in [IsaacLab](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/index.html) using the SO101Leader ([LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot)), including data collection, data conversion, and subsequent policy training.

- 🤖 We use SO101Follower as the robot in IsaacLab and provide relevant teleoperation method.
- 🔄 We offer scripts to convert data from HDF5 format to the LeRobot Dataset.
- 🧠 We utilize simulation-collected data to fine-tune [GR00T N1.5](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T) and deploy it on real hardware.

## Device Setup 🎮

We use the SO101Leader as the teleoperation device. Please follow the [official documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101) for connection and configuration.

## Teleoperation Usage 🕹️

You can run teleoperation tasks with the following script:

```shell
python scripts/environments/teleoperation/teleop_se3_agent.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0 \
    --teleop_device=so101leader \
    --port=/dev/ttyACM0 \
    --num_envs=1 \
    --device=cpu \
    --enable_cameras \
    --record \
    --dataset_file=./datasets/dataset.hdf5
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Parameter descriptions for teleop_se3_agent.py</strong></summary><p></p>

- `--task`: Specify the task environment name to run, e.g., `LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0`.

- `--seed`: Specify the seed for environment, e.g., `42`.

- `--teleop_device`: Specify the teleoperation device type, e.g., `so101leader`, `bi-so101leader`, `keyboard`.

-  `--port`: Specify the port of teleoperation device, e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`. Only used when teleop_device is `so101leader`.

- `--left_arm_port`: Specify the port of left arm, e.g., `/dev/ttyACM0`. Only used when teleop_device is `bi-so101leader`.

- `--right_arm_port`: Specify the port of right arm, e.g., `/dev/ttyACM1`. Only used when teleop_device is `bi-so101leader`.

- `--num_envs`: Set the number of parallel simulation environments, usually `1` for teleoperation.

- `--device`: Specify the computation device, such as `cpu` or `cuda` (GPU).

- `--enable_cameras`: Enable camera sensors to collect visual data during teleoperation.

- `--record`: Enable data recording; saves teleoperation data to an HDF5 file.

- `--dataset_file`: Path to save the recorded dataset, e.g., `./datasets/record_data.hdf5`.

</details>


If the calibration file does not exist at the specified cache path, or if you launch with `--recalibrate`, you will be prompted to calibrate the SO101Leader.  Please refer to the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/lerobot/so101#calibration-video) for calibration steps.

After entering the IsaacLab window, press the `b` key on your keyboard to start teleoperation. You can then use the specified teleop_device to control the robot in the simulation. If you need to reset the environment after completing your operation, simply press the `r` or `n` key. `r` means resetting the environment and marking the task as failed, while `n` means resetting the environment and marking the task as successful.

**Troubleshooting:**

If you encounter permission errors like `ConnectionError`, you may need to run:

```bash
sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0

# or just add your user in related groups
sudo usermod -aG dialout $USER
```

## Dataset Replay 📺

After teleoperation, you can replay the collected dataset in the simulation environment using the following script:

```shell
python scripts/environments/teleoperation/replay.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0 \
    --num_envs=1 \
    --device=cpu \
    --enable_cameras \
    --dataset_file=./datasets/dataset.hdf5 \
    --episode_index=0
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Parameter descriptions for replay.py</strong></summary><p></p>

- `--task`: Specify the task environment name to run, e.g., `LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0`.

- `--num_envs`: Set the number of parallel simulation environments, usually `1` for replay.

- `--device`: Specify the computation device, such as `cpu` or `cuda` (GPU).

- `--enable_cameras`: Enable camera sensors to visualize when replay.

- `--dataset_file`: Path to the recorded dataset, e.g., `./datasets/record_data.hdf5`.

- `--episode_index`: Index of the episode to replay from the dataset, e.g., `0`.

</details>

## Data Convention & Conversion 📊

Collected teleoperation data is stored in HDF5 format in the specified directory. We provide a script to convert HDF5 data to the LeRobot Dataset format. Only successful episode will be converted.

>[!NOTE] 
> This script depends on the LeRobot runtime environment. We recommend using a separate Conda environment for LeRobot—see the official [LeRobot repo](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot?tab=readme-ov-file#installation) for installation instructions.

You can modify the parameters in the script and run the following command:

```bash
python scripts/convert/isaaclab2lerobot.py
```

## Policy Training 🏋️‍♂️

[GR00T N1.5](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T) provides a fine-tuning workflow based on the LeRobot Dataset. You can refer to [nvidia/gr00t-n1.5-so101-tuning](https://huggingface.co/blog/nvidia/gr00t-n1-5-so101-tuning) to fine-tune it with your collected lerobot data. We take pick-orange task as an example.

- First, collect a pick-orange dataset in simulation.
- Then, fine-tune GR00T N1.5 using this data.
- Finally, deploy the trained policy on real hardware.

## Policy Inference 🧩

We also provide interfaces for running policy inference in simulation. You can start inference with the following script (take gr00tn1.5 as example):

```shell
python scripts/evaluation/policy_inference.py \
    --task=LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0 \
    --policy_type=gr00tn1.5 \
    --policy_host=localhost \
    --policy_port=5555 \
    --policy_timeout_ms=5000 \
    --policy_action_horizon=16 \
    --policy_language_instruction="Pick up the orange and place it on the plate" \
    --device=cuda
```

<details>
<summary><strong>Parameter descriptions for policy_inference.py</strong></summary><p></p>

- `--task`: Name of the task environment to run for inference (e.g., `LeIsaac-SO101-PickOrange-v0`).

- `--policy_type`: Type of policy to use (default: `gr00tn1.5`).
    - now we support `gr00tn1.5`.

- `--policy_host`: Host address of the policy server (default: `localhost`).

- `--policy_port`: Port of the policy server (default: `5555`).

- `--policy_timeout_ms`: Timeout for the policy server in milliseconds (default: `5000`).

- `--policy_action_horizon`: Number of actions to predict per inference (default: `16`).

- `--policy_language_instruction`: Language instruction for the policy (e.g., task description in natural language).

- `--policy_checkpoint_path`: Path to the policy checkpoint (if required).

- `--device`: Computation device, such as `cpu` or `cuda`.

You may also use additional arguments supported by IsaacLab's `AppLauncher` (see their documentation for details).

</details>

Depending on your use case, you may need to install additional dependencies to enable inference:

```shell
pip install pyzmq
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> For service-based policies, you must start the corresponding service before running inference. For example, with GR00T, you need to launch the GR00T N1.5 inference server first. You can refer to the [GR00T evaluation documentation](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T?tab=readme-ov-file#4-evaluation) for detailed instructions.
